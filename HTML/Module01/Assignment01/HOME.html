        The <b>National flag of India</b>, colloquially called
        <b>Tiraṅgā (The Tricolour)</b>, is a horizontal rectangular
        <b>Tricolour Flag</b>, the colours being of India saffron, white and
        India green; with the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke wheel, in navy blue at
        its centre.[1][2] It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of
        the Constituent Assembly held on <b>22 July 1947</b>, and it became the
        official flag of the Union of India on <b>15 August 1947</b>. The flag
        was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India,
        the term <b>"Tricolour"</b> almost always refers to the
        <b>Indian National Flag.</b>
