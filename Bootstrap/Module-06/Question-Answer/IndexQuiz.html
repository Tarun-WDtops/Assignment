      <p><b>Q.[1] </b> What are the advantages of Bootstrap?</p>
      <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p>
          <b>Ans. </b>Bootstrap creates responsive websites with an easy,
          functional and stylish framework that saves the web developer time and
          work from coding and recoding simple elements that are used across
          most web projects. Bootstrap provides standard and customised
          preferences affording beginners the opportunity to learn to code and
          seasoned web developers to spend more time on creating unique and
          specific websites.

      <p><b>Q.[2]</b> What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</p>
      <details>
        <summary></summary>
        <p>
          <b>Ans. </b>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap
          and are required when using our default grid system. Containers are
          used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them.
          While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested
          container.
        </p>

        <p><b>Bootstrap comes with three different containers:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em style="color: blueviolet">.container</em>, which sets a
            max-width at each responsive breakpoint.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em style="color: blueviolet">.container-fluid</em> which is
            <em style="color: blueviolet">width: 100%</em> at all breakpoints.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em style="color: blueviolet">.container-{breakpoint} </em>which is
            <em style="color: blueviolet">width: 100%</em> until the specified
            breakpoint.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <b>Ans. </b>Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows,
          and columns to layout and align content. It's built with flexbox and
